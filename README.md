# Map Scraper UI

MapScraper is a Source Engine script that extracts a map's content, such as models, textures, sounds, scripts, etc.

This fork is an attempt to make Map Scraper with a (beautiful) UI.

⚠️ This is a project & WIP fork. I will start working on when I'll be available and no longer busy by exams.
